Overview:

This notebook presents a comprehensive study of foundational concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). It covers the historical evolution, real-world applications, ethical concerns, learning paradigms, and the machine learning project lifecycleâ€”each aligned with practical code snippets and visualizations.


Contents:

-History & Evolution of AI/ML
A structured narrative from early AI concepts (Turing, Perceptron) to deep learning breakthroughs (AlexNet, AlphaGo, ChatGPT), accompanied by a visual timeline.

-Real-World Applications
Sector-wise summary of AI/ML use-cases across Healthcare, Finance, Retail, Transportation, and Manufacturing, supported by a clean infographic.

-Ethical Concerns & Societal Impacts
A reflective paragraph discussing bias, privacy, automation, transparency, and governance, along with practical mitigation strategies.

-Types of Machine Learning
Definitions and real-world examples for Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. Includes a short Python demo of supervised learning.

-ML Pipeline & Lifecycle
Step-by-step explanation and visualization of the typical machine learning lifecycle from problem definition to monitoring.


Tools & Technologies:

Python, Matplotlib (for visualizations), scikit-learn (for demo code)
